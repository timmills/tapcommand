## How to Use

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs:
- `hisensetv==0.3.0` - Hisense TV control library
- `wakeonlan==3.1.0` - Already installed, used for power-on
- `samsungctl==0.7.1` - Already installed for Samsung TVs

### 2. Test with Actual Hisense TV

Edit `test_hisense.py`:
```python
TV_IP = "192.168.101.XX"      # Your TV's IP
TV_MAC = "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"  # Your TV's MAC (for WOL)
```

Run test:
```bash
python test_hisense.py
```

**Tests performed:**
- Connection (with/without SSL)
- Command sending (volume up/down)
- TV info query (sources, volume)
- Wake-on-LAN (optional)

### 3. Adopt Hisense TV

Once TV is discovered:
1. Network scan detects TV on port 36669
2. Device type identified as `hisense_vidaa`
3. Adopt as Virtual Controller via API
4. Commands automatically routed to HisenseExecutor

### 4. Send Commands

```bash
POST /api/commands
{
  "controller_id": "nw-XXXXXX",
  "command": "volume_up",
  "device_type": "network_tv",
  "protocol": "hisense_vidaa"
}
```

---

## Supported Commands

### Basic Controls
- Power: `power`, `power_on`, `power_off`
- Volume: `volume_up`, `volume_down`, `mute`
- Channels: `channel_up`, `channel_down`

### Navigation
- D-pad: `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`
- Select: `ok`, `enter`, `select`
- Menu: `menu`, `home`, `back`, `exit`

### Playback
- Transport: `play`, `pause`, `stop`, `fast_forward`, `rewind`
- Subtitles: `subtitle`

### Numbers
- Digits: `0` through `9`

### Sources
- Direct input: `source_0` through `source_7`

---

## Technical Details

### Protocol: MQTT
- **Port:** 36669
- **Username:** hisenseservice
- **Password:** multimqttservice
- **Library:** hisensetv (Python)

### Connection Behavior
- **SSL:** Auto-detected (tries without, then with if needed)
- **Timeout:** 5 seconds
- **Retry:** Automatic on SSL errors

### Power-On Logic
1. Check if MAC address configured
2. If yes: Send 16 WOL packets
3. Return success (TV takes 5-15 sec to boot)
4. If no MAC: Send MQTT power command (only works if TV in light sleep)

## Comparison: Hisense vs Samsung

| Feature | Hisense | Samsung D-series |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| **Network Control** | ✅ MQTT (port 36669) | ✅ TCP (port 55000) |
| **Power-On (WOL)** | ⚠️ Unreliable | ✗ Not supported |
| **When TV Off** | Deep sleep (no network) | Network powered down |
| **Query State** | ✅ Volume, sources | ✗ No feedback |
| **SSL** | Sometimes required | N/A |
| **Best For** | Control when ON | Control when ON |
| **Power-On** | WOL or IR fallback | IR only |

**Conclusion:** Hisense is better than Samsung for network control, but both need IR for reliable power-on.

---

## Known Limitations

### Wake-on-LAN
- ⚠️ **Not all models support WOL**
- ⚠️ **Reliability varies** - some models work, others don't
- ⚠️ **Deep sleep issue** - MQTT broker stops when TV fully off
- ✅ **Solution:** Use IR control for power-on fallback

### SSL Requirements
- Some models need SSL enabled
- Some models fail with SSL
- Executor handles this automatically

### Library Status
- `hisensetv` is **no longer maintained** (as of 2024)
- Still functional and stable
- Widely used in Home Assistant

---

## Recommended Approach

### Hybrid Control Strategy

**Power ON:** IR Control (guaranteed to work)
**Power OFF:** Network MQTT (faster)
**All Other Commands:** Network MQTT (fast + feedback)

**Why?**
- IR always works for power-on
- Network is faster and provides state feedback
- Best of both worlds

## Testing Checklist

Before using in production:

- [ ] Test connection with/without SSL
- [ ] Verify volume commands work
- [ ] Test channel navigation
- [ ] Test power toggle
- [ ] Test WOL (if TV supports it)
- [ ] Measure command latency (should be < 500ms)
- [ ] Test error handling (TV off, wrong IP)
- [ ] Verify discovery detects TV correctly
- [ ] Test adoption as Virtual Controller
- [ ] Send commands via TapCommand API

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test Hisense TV
# Edit test_hisense.py first!
python test_hisense.py

# Check if TV is detected
curl http://localhost:8000/api/network-tv/discovered

# Send command (after adoption)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/commands \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "controller_id": "nw-XXXXXX",
    "command": "volume_up",
    "device_type": "network_tv",
    "protocol": "hisense_vidaa"
  }'
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test with actual Hisense TV**
   - Run test script
   - Verify all commands work
   - Document any model-specific quirks

2. **Verify WOL Support**
   - Test if your specific model supports WOL
   - Document reliability
   - Implement IR fallback if needed

3. **Production Deployment**
   - Monitor executor performance
   - Track command success rate
   - Optimize timeout values if needed

4. **Optional Enhancements**
   - Add app launching commands (Netflix, YouTube)
   - Implement state polling (volume, current source)
   - Add model-specific optimizations

**Implementation Complete:** October 6, 2025
**Status:** Ready for testing with real Hisense TV
**Confidence:** High - based on well-tested library and similar Samsung implementation
